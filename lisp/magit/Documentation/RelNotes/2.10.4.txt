Magit v2.10.4 Release Notes (unreleased)
========================================

Changes since v2.10.3
---------------------

* The popup `magit-remote-popup' now exposes the `-f' switch for `git
  remote add', which allows the user to control whether information
  from the remote is fetched after the remote is added.  The default
  behavior is still to fetch after adding a remote (i.e., the switch
  is enabled by default).  #2997

Fixes since v2.10.3
-------------------

* Rebasing was sometimes interrupted by an error about the index lock
  already being held.  This happened because VC asynchronously checks
  for files with conflict, which involved using a git command that
  grabs the lock.  Magit now redefines that VC command to use a git
  command that does not grab the lock.  #2708, debbug#21559
