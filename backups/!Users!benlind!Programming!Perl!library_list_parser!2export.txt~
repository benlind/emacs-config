NOTE         Narrated by Jonathan Davis.
NOTE         Abraham Lincoln wondered whether "in a free government the 
               minority have the right to break up the government." Jefferson 
               Davis felt "forced to take up arms" to guarantee his states' 
               rights. McPherson merges the words of these men and other 
               political luminaries, housewives, and soldiers from both armies
               with his own concise analysis of the war to create a story as 
               compelling as any novel.

NOTE         The year is 1805 and Europe has fallen to Napoleon. The Royal 
               Navy is the only thing standing in his way to total victory. 
               Off the coast of South America, a new conflict is brewing. 
               Captain Jack 'Lucky Jack' Aubrey and his Man-of-War HMS 
               Surprise is under orders to sink or capture the French 
               privateer Acheron, which has been deployed to the region. After
               seven weeks of uneventful sailing, the Acheron strikes first, 
               all but crippling the Surprise in an engagement in which Aubrey
               realizes his enemy's ship is nautically superior to his own. 
               Along with his close friend and confidant, ship's surgeon 
               Stephan Maturin, Aubrey is now faced with the choice of 
               retreating to England and admitting defeat or remaining at the 
               Acheron's mercy. Aubrey must now do the impossible if he is to

               Acheron.

               they strike an object: they can bounce, they can pass through; 
               or they can be absorbed. The Islanders also studied lenses to 
               bend light, and they looked through telescopes, periscopes, and

NOTE         In 1959, as part of the dedication ceremony for a new elementary 
               school, a group of students is asked to draw pictures to be 
               stored in a time capsule. One mysterious girl fills her sheet 
               of paper with rows of apparently random numbers instead. Fifty 
               years later, a new generation of students examines the 
               capsule's contents and the girl's cryptic message ends up in 
               the hands of Caleb. But it is Caleb's father, professor John 
               Koestler, who makes the startling discovery that the encoded 
               message predicts with pinpoint accuracy the dates, death tolls 
               and coordinates of every major disaster of the past 50 years. 
               With the reluctant help of the daughter of the now-deceased 
               author of the prophecies, John's increasingly desperate efforts
               take him on a race against time until he finds himself facing 
               the ultimate disaster and the ultimate sacrifice.
NOTE         Special features: audio commentary with director Alex Proyas; 
               Knowing all: the making of a futuristic thriller; visions of

NOTE         On the planet Cybertron, a war was waged between the Autobots and
               the Decepticons for control of the Allspark, a mystical 
               talisman that would grant unlimited power to whoever possessed 
               it. The Allspark is smuggled off the planet, but Megatron goes 
               in search of it. He tracks it to Earth and his desire for power
               sends him into the Arctic Ocean. The sheer cold forces him into
               a paralyzed state. His body is later recovered, and before 
               going into a comatose state he uses the last of his energy to 
               engrave a map, showing the location of the Allspark, into the 
               Captain's glasses. A century later, Spike buys his first car. 
               To his shock, he discovers it is an Autobot in disguise. He is 
               to protect Spike, who bears the Captain's glasses. Other 
               Transformers have arrived In the desert of Qatar and the 
               Decepticons attack a U.S. military base. Spike and his 
               girlfriend Mikaela find themselves in the middle of a grand 
               battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Meanwhile, 
               within the depths of Hoover Dam, the cryogenically stored form 
               of Megatron awakens.
